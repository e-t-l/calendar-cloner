This repo contains the source code of Calendar Cloner and Calendar Cloner FREE, both Android apps that can be found in Google Play.

Since the initial release a lot has happened in my personal life. And although I could support the app for a number of years after, that is no longer the case. It is not a lack of interest, but a lack of time. I hope that by releasing the code, someone else can pick up where I left.

With regards to the code itself, please be forgiving to what I produced. It works perfectly in many cases, but the code structure can be much improved. This was my first big(ger) Java project so back then I still had a lot to learn.

If someone has any questions regarding it, feel free to contact me.

And as always, happy cloning.

Cheers
  Jeroen
